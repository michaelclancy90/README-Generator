## **Introduction** 
<br />
  For the task, I was to create a Readme generator using Node.js runtime environment. The application should use the inquirer package, and allow the user to create the markdown file using the command line.
<br />

## **User Story**
<br />
AS A developer
 <br />
I WANT a README generator
 <br />
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
 <br />
<br />

## **Acceptance Criteria**
<br />
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input <br />
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository <br />
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions <br />
WHEN I enter my project title <br />
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README  <br />
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions <br />
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests <br />
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options <br />
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under <br />
WHEN I enter my GitHub username <br />
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile <br />
WHEN I enter my email address <br />
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions <br />
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents <br />
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README <br />
 <br />

## Installation
  The user must have node installed. Then use npm install to install the required dependencies.

## Usage
  The user must utilize the command line and answer the prompted questions.  
## Contributing
I completed this assignment with the help of my lecturers and TA's.
